# Opinion-dynamics-on-hypergraphs
Code for the Digital Epidemiology course exam project.

The purpose of this project is to reproduce some of the results presented in [Iacopini et al. (2022) _Group interactions modulate critical mass dynamics in social convention_](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-022-00845-y).  

* _'OpinionDynamicsOnHypergraphs.ipynb'_ is the main notebook for the exam project.  
* _'MultipleRuns_fixed_p.ipynb'_ is a notebook used to run multiple simulations and collect the results. The results I used in the main notebook are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_Z69ZHok8SPWF0oeDT8mmLmIu5DTYCz1?usp=drive_link); if you intend to use them in the main notebook, make sure to download the 'Simulation_Results' folder and put it in the same directory of the notebooks.  
* _'GIF_code.ipynb'_ is a notebook containing the code to create an animation of the opinion-spreading dynamics.
